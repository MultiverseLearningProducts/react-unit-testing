# React component unit testing

## Background & resources

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows creation of Single Page Apps (SPAs) which can change data without reloading the page.

In this lesson we are going to be learning about the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). This library allows us to test each React component in isolation (unit testing).

The learning today is based on the excellent [React Testing Libary Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gm4_-5UsNmLqMosM-dzuvQ) from [the Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja). I recommend you watch all of these videos offline. You should also refer to the [React Testing Library Cheatsheet](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet) for a quick reference to all the available functions in the library.

## Pre-requisites
* Installation of VSCode
* Installation of the [Chrome React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
* A basic understanding of React. We recommend the following tutorials:
   * https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
   * [Full Modern React Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d) 

## Getting started
1. `git clone https://github.com/harblaith7/React-Testing-Library-Net-Ninja`
1. `cd React-Testing-Library-Net-Ninja`
1. `git checkout 01-Starter-Project`
1. Open VSCode and bring up a terminal in the `React-Testing-Library-Net-Ninja` directory.
1. `npm install`

To run the sample React app type `npm start`
To run the tests, create another terminal window and type `npm run test` (or `npm run test -t <name of test class>`)

## Creating your own React app
We recommend following the [Simple React Shopping Cart for Absolute Beginners video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmIdY1Eb8tY) and modifying this to suit your chosen application.
