# React component unit testing

## Background & resources

In this lesson we are going to be learning about the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). This library allows us to test each React component in isolation (unit testing).

The learning today is based on the excellent [React Testing Libary Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gm4_-5UsNmLqMosM-dzuvQ) from [the Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja). I recommend you watch all of these videos offline.

## Getting started
`git clone https://github.com/harblaith7/React-Testing-Library-Net-Ninja`

`git checkout 01-Starter-Project`

## Creating your own React app
We recommend following the [Simple React Shopping Cart for Absolute Beginners video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmIdY1Eb8tY) and modifying this to suit your chosen application
